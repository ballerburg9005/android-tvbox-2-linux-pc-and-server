**Transform a $30 Android TVbox into a home PC, media center and server for all your data.**

This project is incomplete and quite inactive.

Ultimately I wanted to make an image for a certain box, where everything was working flawlessly. I also started documenting all the important steps how other people can make an image themselves.  There is no image yet, but you can check

for instructions.

❌ The USB 3.0 ports of my X96 Max+ started failing (producing read/write errors and USB disconnects randomly) after I used them with an old SSD as main drive for a few weeks without issue. This is when I gave up. Maybe it is just a fault in this one box. I have been using other Amlogic devices and they run very stable and reliable with SD cards and USB 2.0 sticks. But I believe it is the USB 3.0 specifically that's not all that up to spec with those boxes. It probably can't handle nowhere near the huge bandwidths, and then it might just overheat and fail. With USB 2.0 you only get 20MB/s and that is well enough for a mailserver, webserver and most other home server applications. Even for a better-than-nothing home PC it can be ok-ish enough. Still though, it is a whole lot less attractive. Maybe it is better to just spent a few more bucks on a Rasperry Pi. ❌
