**Transform a $30 Android TVbox into a home PC, media center and server for all your data.**

This project is incomplete and quite inactive.

Ultimately I wanted to make an image for a certain cheap box (most are Amlogic), where everything was working flawlessly. I also started documenting all the important steps how other people can make an image themselves.  There is no image yet, but you can check 

[The Wiki](https://github.com/ballerburg9005/android-tvbox-2-linux-pc-and-server/wiki) 

for instructions.

* I recommend you use an SSD via USB with external USB power supply (might crash otherwise)
