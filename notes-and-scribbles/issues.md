Mecool Ki Pro
-------------

- put display to sleep = never - to avoid freeze?
- upower not working: likely the cause of the error popup at start
- sssd had to be disabled after installation (but no one needs it anyway) - didn't happen first time I installed

X96 Max Plus
------------

- Installer instantly crashed first time and then never tried to run again
- something else still crashes at boot
