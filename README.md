# linux-tvbox-revolution
Transform a $30 TVbox into a home PC, media center and server for all your data. Fiddle-free and pre-tested. 

I just begun this project and only use this as a scratchpatch.


how the images are made 
-----------------------

* Fastest way to run any distro: Combine a precompiled Libreelec kernel with distribution image of choice
* Compile Kernel: this is is most cases not required
* Configuring Distribution: speedups, etc.
* **TODO** autoscripts Yunohost

for endusers
------------

* community infrastructure to have image flashed
* crash course on tv boxes for computer clubs / tech savvy friends
* instructions to flash image without help
