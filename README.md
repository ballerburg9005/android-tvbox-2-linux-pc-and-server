# Transform a $30 Android TVbox into a home PC, media center and server for all your data. 

I just begun this project and only use this as a scratchpatch.

Anything usable is available in [The Wiki](https://github.com/ballerburg9005/android-tvbox-into-linux-plus-server/wiki) and can be edited by anyone.


# NOTES

how the images are made 
-----------------------

* Fastest way to run any distro: Combine a precompiled Libreelec kernel with distribution image of choice
* Compile Kernel: this is is most cases not required
* Configuring Distribution: speedups, etc.
* **TODO** autoscripts Yunohost
* **TODO** all written so far is written for doing proof-of-concept work, the endgoal is to create a working modded image not a working installation

for endusers
------------

* community infrastructure to have image flashed
* crash course on tv boxes for computer clubs / tech savvy friends
* instructions to flash image without help
